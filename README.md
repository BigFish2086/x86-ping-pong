# üèì x86-ping-pong

> x86-ping-pong is a 2 level assembly ping pong that could be played by two players on the same device or using x86-serial port.
> The game has two levels. The first level is just the game and the winner is the one who scores 3 points.
> The second level is much harder as moving directions are reversed and the game is a little faster.
> One player is choosing the whether to start the game or start chatting. Then he sends an invitation to the second player (which he could accept or refuse).
> The two players are able to chat in the game, too.
